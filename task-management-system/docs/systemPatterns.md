# System Design & Architecture

> **Current Phase:** ðŸš§ DevOps & Deployment (Phase 4)
> - CI/CD, Docker, and Ansible are the next focus areas.
> - High-level and low-level design, C4, and UML are up to date with current implementation.

## High-Level Design
The system is a layered Spring Boot application with RESTful APIs, a MySQL database, and CI/CD integration.

### Main Components
- API Layer (Controllers)
- Service Layer (Business Logic)
- Data Layer (Repositories, JPA)
- Security Layer (JWT, Spring Security)
- Configuration Layer (YAML, Ansible)

### Integration Points
- Jenkins (CI/CD)
- JFrog Artifactory (Artifacts)
- Docker (Containerization)
- Ansible (Configuration)
- Postman (API Testing)

## Low-Level Design
- DTOs for data transfer
- Exception handling with custom exceptions
- Service classes for business logic
- Repository interfaces for data access

## C4 Model
- **Context:** Application interacts with users, CI/CD, database, artifact repo
- **Container:** Spring Boot app, MySQL DB, Jenkins, JFrog, Docker
- **Component:** Controllers, Services, Repositories, Security, Config
- **Code:** Follows Java/Spring best practices

## UML Diagrams
- Class, sequence, and activity diagrams to be added as the implementation progresses.
