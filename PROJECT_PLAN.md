   - Code review by team members
   - Address feedback and iterate

4. **Testing**:
   - Run unit and integration tests
   - Test API with Postman collection
   - Verify code quality with SonarQube

5. **Continuous Integration**:
   - Jenkins pipeline builds and tests code
   - Pipeline publishes artifacts to JFrog
   - Deploy to development environment

6. **Release Process**:
   - Create release branch from `develop`
   - Final testing and verification
   - Deploy to staging via Jenkins pipeline
   - Merge to `main` and tag release
   - Deploy to production via Jenkins pipeline

### SCRUM Process
